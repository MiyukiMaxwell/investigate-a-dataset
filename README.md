Project Overview
In this project, I analysed a dataset from [tmdb]<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata> and then communicated my findings about it.
I used Python libraries NumPy and pandas to make my analysis easier.

This project demonstrated my ability to:
-Use a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis tasks
-Explore and inspect data using NumPy and pandas
-Manipulate data using NumPy and pandas
-Present conclusions about data using pandas visualizations
